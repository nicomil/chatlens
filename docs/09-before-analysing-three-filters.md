# Before analysing: three filters

**`group_valid == 1`** — excludes the interrupted triads and those where at
least one member let a timer expire, as agreed. The full sample stays available
for robustness checks. The column has the same name in both files.

**`low_language_flag == 0`** — excludes text that is not language. It is needed
because keyboard mashing comes out paradoxically *maximally analytic*: the index
subtracts the function words, and a text containing none suffers no subtraction
at all. On the pilot, groups made only of test strings scored a median of 93
against 43 for the real groups.

The flag carries the prefix of the block it refers to, so use the one consistent
with the measures being analysed: `nlp_sent_low_language_flag`,
`nlp_dyad_low_language_flag`, `nlp_group_low_language_flag`. On very short units
the threshold does not trip, so at the dyadic level it must be read together
with `nlp_sent_wc`.

**`nlp_sent_wc > 0`** (or the `wc` of the block in use) — units with no text
have **blank** indices by construction, not zeros: without this filter they
would enter the means as missing values rather than as an absence of
conversation.
